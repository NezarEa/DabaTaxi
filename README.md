# DabaTaxi App

## Description

DabaTaxi is an Android application that simulates a taxi fare meter, providing real-time tracking of distance, time, and fare calculation for drivers. The app displays the current position of the driver on a Google Map and updates the fare dynamically based on distance and time. The app is designed to help simulate taxi fares for both customers and drivers with an interactive and smooth user interface.

### Features:
1. **Real-time Map Tracking**: Shows the current position of the driver using Google Maps API.
2. **Taxi Fare Calculation**:
   - Base fare.
   - Fare per kilometer.
   - Fare per minute.
3. **Dynamic Fare Updates**: Updates the fare in real-time based on distance and time.
4. **Start/Stop Ride**: Button to start the ride and calculate the fare.
5. **Notifications**: Sends a notification with the total fare, distance, and time at the end of the trip.
6. **Permissions**: Handles location permissions using EasyPermissions.
7. **Animations**: Smooth animations for UI transitions, including map movement and fare updates.

## Technologies Used:
- **Android**: Kotlin, Google Maps API, FusedLocationProviderClient, EasyPermissions.
- **Server**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, JWT Authentication, Multer (for file uploads).
- **UI/UX**: MotionLayout, Lottie animations, Material Design.
